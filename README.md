# codingCompetition
This repository is dedicated to a coding competition that I was a part of earlier in 2023
It includes an algorithm to calculate the sum of unique "hip numbers" within a certain range
The second algorithm counts the frequency of words that are within a given string
The third algorithm finds the sum of all integers that are within a given text file that are only greater than 75
The fourth algorithm gives a string as input, and outputs a new string where:
A. Every occurence of the letter X has been replaced with a Y, and B. every vowel(A,E,I,O,U) has been moved to the end of the string, in the same order as in the original string.
